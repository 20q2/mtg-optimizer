# Mtg card optimizer
https://20q2.github.io/mtg-optimizer/

## Todo list:
- Mana value curves
- track number of lands, compare to the total deck ratio and best practices
- Give card suggstions based on commander tags

## How to run
To run the app you'll need to run a local flask server. To do this, make sure you have the flask_server.py file locally and run the command `python flask_server.py`.

It may ask you to download some dependencies to have it run, to do so use the command `pip install <dependency>`. Consult google if you need help getting pip going.

After the server is running, assuming its running on the default port, the app should talk to your local server on its own and run as intended.
